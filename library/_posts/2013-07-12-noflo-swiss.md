Swiss Army Knife for NoFlo Programming [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kenhkan/noflo-swiss.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kenhkan/noflo-swiss)
===============================

This module provides useful utilities for your everyday needs
programming in NoFlo. Some of them are simple proxies of
[Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) functions.


Qualifications
------------------------------

Anything that doesn't quite fit anywhere else in a module is accepted.
They're mostly proxies to existing libraries in the good ol' JavaScript
world such as Underscore.js.

There are many of these odd utilities. Even the Underscore.js library
isn't completely included. If you have the time and a favorite utility,
please contribute. I'll try to incorporate them as soon as time allows!
