* **Process**: an instance of a component that is running as part of a graph (also known as Node in non-live graphs)
* **Runtime**: an environment capable of running flow-based programs. For example NoFlo or JavaFBP
* **Connection**: connection between an outport of a Process, and inport of another Process (also known as Edge in non-live graphs)
* **Initial Information Packet** (IIP): predefined data packet sent to a defined inport of a Process
* **Information Packet** (IP): Packets of information with either a type of `data`, `openBracket`, or `closeBracket`.
