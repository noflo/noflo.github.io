### NoFlo graph file format

- [JSON](#json)
- [FBP](#fbp)
- [Subgraphs](#subgraphs)

-------------
# <a name="json"></a>JSON

In addition to using NoFlo in _embedded mode_ where you create the FBP graph programmatically ([see example](https://raw.github.com/noflo/noflo/master/examples/linecount/count.coffee)), you can also initialize and run graphs defined using a JSON file.

The NoFlo JSON files declare the processes used in the FBP graph, and the connections between them. They look like the following:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "name": "Count lines in a file"
  },
  "processes": {
    "Read File": {
      "component": "ReadFile",
      "metadata": {
        ...
      }
    },
    "Split by Lines": {
      "component": "SplitStr"
    },
    ...
  },
  "connections": [
    {
      "data": "package.json",
      "tgt": {
        "process": "Read File",
        "port": "source"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": {
        "process": "Read File",
        "port": "out"
      },
      "tgt": {
        "process": "Split by Lines",
        "port": "in"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

To run a graph file, you can either use the _load_ command of the NoFlo shell, or do it programmatically:

```coffeescript
noflo = require "noflo"
noflo.loadFile "example.json", (network) ->
  console.log "Graph loaded"
  console.log network.graph.toDOT()
```
```javascript
var noflo = require("noflo");
noflo.loadFile("example.json", function(network) {
  console.log("Graph loaded");
  console.log(network.graph.toDOT());
});
```

-------------
# <a name="fbp"></a>FBP

In addition to the JSON format described above, FBP has its own Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for easy graph definition. The syntax is the following:

* `'somedata' -> PORT Process(Component)` sends initial data _somedata_ to port _PORT_ of process _Process_ that runs component _Component_
* `A(Component1) X -> Y B(Component2)` sets up a connection between port _X_ of process _A_ that runs component _Component1_ and port _Y_ of process _B_ that runs component _Component2_

You can connect multiple components and ports together on one line, and separate connection definitions with a newline or a comma (`,`).

You can find more information in the [README of the stand-alone FBP parser](https://github.com/noflo/fbp#readme).

Example:

```coffeescript
'somefile.txt' -> SOURCE Read(ReadFile) OUT -> IN Split(SplitStr)
Split OUT -> IN Count(Counter) COUNT -> IN Display(Output)
Read ERROR -> IN Display
```

## Loading and running graphs

NoFlo supports the FBP language fully. You can either load a graph with a string of FBP-language commands with:

```coffeescript
fbpData = "<some FBP language connections>"

noflo = require "noflo"
noflo.graph.loadFbp fbpData, (graph) ->
  console.log "Graph loaded"
  console.log graph.toDOT()
```
```javascript
var fbpData = "<some FBP language connections>";

var noflo = require("noflo");
noflo.graph.loadFbp(fbpData, function(graph) {
  console.log("Graph loaded");
  console.log(graph.toDOT());
 });
```

The `.fbp` file suffix is used for files containing FBP language. This means you can load them also the same way as you load JSON files, using the `noflo.loadFile` method, or the NoFlo shell. Example:

```bash
$ noflo examples/linecount/count.fbp
```

## FBP to JSON
[flowbased](https://github.com/flowbased/fbp) can be used to convert your FBP to JSON.

## Inline FBP in web applications

In addition to separate files, FBP graph definitions can also be defined inline in HTML. The typical way to do this is to utilize a `script` tag. For example, the following would change the contents of an element identified with the ID `header` to say *Hello World*:

```html
<script type="application/fbp" id="main">
  '#header' -> SELECTOR GetHeader(dom/GetElement)
  'Hello World' -> HTML WriteContent(dom/WriteHTML)
  GetHeader ELEMENT -> CONTAINER WriteContent
</script>
```

Loading and running inline FBP is quite simple:

```coffeescript
# Get the FBP contents
fbp = document.getElementById('main').textContent.trim()

# Load the NoFlo graph based on the FBP string
noflo.graph.loadFBP fbp, (graph) ->
  # Run the graph
  noflo.createNetwork graph
```
```javascript
// Get the FBP contents
var fbp = document.getElementById('main').textContent.trim();

// Load the NoFlo graph based on the FBP string
noflo.graph.loadFBP(fbp, function (graph) {

  // Run the graph
  noflo.createNetwork(graph);
});
```

# Subgraphs

A NoFlo graph may contain multiple subgraphs, managed by instances of the `Graph` component. Subgraphs are useful for packaging particular flows to be used as a "new component" by other flows. This allows building more advanced functionality by creating reusable graphs of connected components.

The Graph component loads the graph given to it as a new NoFlo network, and looks for unattached ports in it. It then exposes these ports as its own inports or outports. This way a graph containing subgraphs can easily connect data between the main graph and the subgraph.

Unattached ports from the subgraph will be available through naming `ProcessName.port` on the Graph component instance.

A simple example, using a subgraph as a component by splitting [linecount example fbp](https://github.com/noflo/noflo/blob/master/examples/linecount/count.fbp) into two files:

### Count
```coffeescript
# File: graphs/count.fbp
INPORT=Read.IN:FILENAME
OUTPORT=Count.COUNT:COUNT
OUTPORT=Read.ERROR:ERROR

# Split the file contents by newlines
Read(ReadFile) OUT -> IN Split(SplitStr)
# Count the packets
Split() OUT -> IN Count(Counter)
```

### Main
```coffeescript
# File: graphs/main.fbp

# Read a file (using our subgraph defined above)
'package.json' -> IN Count(Count)
Count() COUNT -> IN Display(Output)

# Display also file read errors
Count() ERROR -> IN Display()
```

A more advanced example, specifying what file a spreadsheet-parsing subgraph should run with:

```coffeescript
# Load a subgraph as a new process
'examples/spreadsheet/parse.fbp' -> GRAPH Reader(Graph)
# Send the filename to the component (subgraph)
'somefile.xls' -> READ.SOURCE Reader()
# Display the results
Reader() ENTITIZE.OUT -> IN Display(Output)
```

Just like with components, it is possible to share subgraphs via NPM. You have to register them in your `package.json`, for example:

```json
{
  "name": "noflo-spreadsheet",
  "noflo": {
    "graphs": {
      "Parse": "./graphs/parse.fbp"
    }
  }
}
```

After this the subgraph is available as a "virtual component" with the name `spreadsheet/Parse` and can be used just like any other component. Subgraphs exported in this manner can be in either JSON or the `.fbp` format.
