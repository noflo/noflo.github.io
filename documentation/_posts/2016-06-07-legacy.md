## <a name="wirepattern-vs-process"></a> WirePattern vs process

### Firing
WirePattern | Process
| --- | --- |
| when all of the data from the ports defined in the `in` param and the `required` param ports have data, it is triggered. | It is fired every time new data comes into any of the ports, you decide whether it matches the preconditions |

### Buffer
WirePattern | Process
| --- | --- |
| if it is ordered (which it is by default), if you have for example `in: ['one', 'two']` and `two` gets data before `one`, the packet for `two` will be dropped. Then if a packet comes to `one` and the next one comes to `two`, it will be triggered. | every packet that comes in is appended to the buffer for the port it was sent to, when you use `get*` functions or manually access the buffer, some or all data will be removed from the buffer. |

### State
WirePattern | Process
| --- | --- |
| to keep state, either properties are set on the component, or params are used depending on the situation. | data can be kept in the buffer by using the buffer helper methods and removing it when done. |


### Concurrency
WirePattern | Process
| --- | --- |
| no concurrency | concurrency for free with packet `scope` |


### Accessing ports
WirePattern | Process
| --- | --- |
| anywhere that has access to the component, use `component.outPorts.portname` or `component.inPorts.portname`. | inside process api function `output.ports.portname`, or `input.ports.portname`, or when [accessing input](/process-api/#getting) or when [sending](/process-api/#sending). |

<a name="async"></a>
## <a name="asynchronous-components"></a>Asynchronous components
Asynchronous components process data and send output some time later. The outputs are sent in the order that they are processed, which might be a different than the order received.

Previously, we used a dedicated class named `AsyncComponent` which would be extended.

Now, [process api](/documentation/process-api) is asynchronous by default.

WirePattern can be used for async by setting the `async` property. [WirePattern Async](/documentation/legacy/#async)


## <a name="wirepattern">WirePattern</a>


{% highlight coffeescript %}
exports.getComponent = ->
c = new noflo.Component
# when you are finished processing, call `done`
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c, (data, groups, out, done) ->
    done()
{% endhighlight %}



### 1) in & out array

``` coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # When `in` has an array, it will put them all into an object as the object properties
  # When `out` has an array, it will make the out an object and put each output as the objects properties
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: ['in', 'eh'] # the inPorts to recieve from
    out: ['out', 'canada'] # the outPorts to send out of
    async: true # whether the component is asynchronous or not
  , (data, groups, out, done) ->
    out.out.send data.out
    out.canada.send data.eh
    done()
```

### 2) in & out singular

```coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # When `in` only has one string, it is only the data sent to it
  # When `out` is only one string, is is only the port to send out of
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: 'eh'
    out: 'canada'
    async: true
  , (eh, groups, out, done) ->
    out.send eh
    done()
```
### 3) forwardGroups

```coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # `forwardGroups` is similar to using forwardBrackets in process api, it takes groups from each `in` sent to it and sends them to each `out` wrapping them.
  # it would forward group IPs from
  # inputs to the output sending them along with the data. This option also
  # accepts string or array values, if you want to forward groups from specific
  # port(s) only. By default group forwarding is `false`.
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: ['eh', 'moose']
    out: 'canada'
    async: true
    forwardGroups: true
  , (data, groups, out, done) ->
    out.send eh
    done()
```

### 4) group

```coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # `group` will ensure that WirePattern will only fire when each `in` has received data wrapped in the same group (ie, `eh` receives the same groups as `moose`)
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: ['eh', 'moose']
    out: 'canada'
    async: true
    forwardGroups: true
    group: true
  , (data, groups, out, done) ->
    out.send eh
    done()
```

### 5) ordered

```coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # using `ordered` will make sure the data that is received in the order you defined it in the `in`, in this case, `eh` before `moose`

  # With `config.group = true` it checks incoming group IPs and collates
  # data with matching group IPs. By default this kind of grouping is `false`.
  # Set `config.group` to a RegExp object to correlate inputs only if the
  # group matches the expression (e.g. `^req_`). For non-matching groups
  # the component will act normally.
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: ['eh', 'moose']
    out: 'canada'
    async: true
    forwardGroups: true
    group: true
    ordered: true
  , (data, groups, out, done) ->
    out.send eh
    done()
```

### 6) params

```coffeescript
exports.getComponent = ->
  c = new noflo.Component

  # using `params` will keep whatever the last data that was sent to it under `c.params.name`. For example here, `c.params.igloo`. Important to note it will not wait for params before firing.
  noflo.helpers.WirePattern c,
    in: ['eh', 'moose']
    params: ['igloo']
    out: 'canada'
    async: true
    forwardGroups: true
    group: true
    ordered: true
  , (data, groups, out, done) ->
    console.log c.params.igloo
    out.send eh
    done()
```

`dropInput` makes all input that comes before receiving `required` params.


<div class="note">
if you do not specify an `in` port it will use the inPort named `in` by default if it exists, the same for `out`
</div>

## <a name="Translation">Translation</a>


In process api, there are no `connect` and `disconnect` events inside of the `process` function. However, for backwards compatibility, they are translated when sending out.

### Old to new
* _Connect_: is translated into _OpenBracket_
* _BeginGroup_: is translated into _OpenBracket_
* _EndGroup_: is translated into _CloseBracket_
* _Disconnect_: is translated into _CloseBracket_

### New to old
* The outtermost _OpenBracket_: is converted to _Connect_
* The outtermost _CloseBracket_: is converted to _Connect_
* _OpenBracket_ (aside from the outtermost): are translated into _BeginGroup_
* _CloseBracket_ (aside from the outtermost): are translated into _EndGroup_

This means if you send out events using the new API, you can use the old way of listening to it, and vice versa.

<div class="note">
 When you send an IP, if you do not send an openBracket and closeBracket explicitly, or let the forwardBrackets do the wrapping for you, every packet you send will emit its own openBracket and closeBracket.
</div>

          description: 'if something goes wrong copying or writing the file'

    # WirePattern had forwardGroups firing definition, it sends every bracket received to every outport, process api you can manually define which brackets go where
    c.forwardBrackets =
      source: ['out', 'error']
      destination: ['out', 'error']

    # change from WirePattern to process
    # WirePattern had `async` firing definition, process api is async by default
    c.process (input, output) ->
      # WirePattern had the `in` firing input port definition, in process it gets called on any event so we just return unless it has packets for these
      return unless input.has 'source', 'destination'

      # instead of passing in the data we want in WirePattern, we get out the data we want
      rs = fs.createReadStream input.getData('source')
      ws = fs.createWriteStream input.getData('destination')

      # will send the data to sendDone which will send it out of `error` port because it is sent an Error object
      rs.on 'error', output.sendDone
      ws.on 'error', output.sendDone

      rs.pipe ws
      rs.on 'end', ->
