- could use a library for words and such but this is for simplicity
- could use an object, {canada: 1, poutine: .5, timmy: 2, timmies: 3, sorry: 11}
- send them each to a component which takes in a word and a weight,
- which sends them all out wrapped in brackets as a stream
- or just use an already made list of them
